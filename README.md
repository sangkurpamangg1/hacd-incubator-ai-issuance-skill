# HACD Incubator AI Issuance Skill

> **Bitcoin proved PoW for money. HACD brings PoW to assets.**

An AI-assisted issuance workflow for the HACD Labs Incubator Cohort 2 campaign.  
Turn a raw project idea into a complete, validated HACD Stack Token launch package — in one AI session, no coding required.

**Apply:** https://hacd.it/incubator  
**Launchpad:** https://hacd.it/launchpad  
**Campaign rules + $500 reward pool:** see `CAMPAIGN.md`

## What this is

This repo is an AI skill — a set of structured prompts and templates you load into Claude or ChatGPT. Once loaded, the AI becomes a HACD Stack issuance expert that knows the full Hacash ecosystem, the correct terminology, the supply math rules, and every safety check required before a project can go live on the Launchpad.

It generates 8 documents per project. It validates the math. It self-reviews for unsafe claims. It scores submissions so HACD Labs can rank them objectively.

```
You give it:  a project idea + 9 Google Form answers
It gives you: 8 complete launch documents, validated and review-ready
Time:         under 10 minutes
```

## Live example projects

Two complete working packages are included in this repo. Both pass the validator with no errors.

| Project | Ticker | Type | Lots | Supply | Stack Cost | Folder |
|---------|--------|------|------|--------|------------|--------|
| StackFire | SFR | FT | 100 | 1,000,000 | 50 HAC | `examples/example_community_token/` |
| HacashBuilders | BUILD | FT + NFT | 500 | 10,000,000 | 50 HAC | `hacashbuilders/` |

These are not mockups. Each folder contains all 8 required documents. Run the validator on either one:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_launch_spec.py examples/example_community_token/launch_spec.json
python3 scripts/validate_launch_spec.py hacashbuilders/launch_spec.json
```

Open claude.ai or chatgpt.com. Paste the contents of `SKILL.md` as your first message.

**Step 2 — Expand your application**
Paste `prompts/google_form_to_intake.md` + your 9 Google Form answers. The AI expands them into a full 40-field intake form automatically.

**Step 3 — Generate all 8 documents**
Tell the AI: *"Generate all 8 documents using this intake form."*

**Step 4 — Validate**
```bash
python3 scripts/validate_launch_spec.py your_project/launch_spec.json
```

**Step 5 — Self-review**
Paste `prompts/roast_mode.md` + all 8 documents. Fix every issue it finds.

**Step 6 — Submit**
Send your complete package to HACD Labs via hacd.it/incubator.

## Use with Claude Code (ccr)

If you have Claude Code Router installed:

```bash
ccr start
ccr code "Load the system prompt from prompts/acp_agent_system_prompt.md and help me design a Stack Token for [your project name] with [N] lots"
```

The ACP agent system prompt at `prompts/acp_agent_system_prompt.md` contains full Hacash ecosystem knowledge including live reference data from Carat Protocol, HAC market links, wallet and explorer links, and real stack cost benchmarks.
